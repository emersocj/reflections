Descripe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than the master branch? What benefits does this approach have?

Changes to the master branch, when working with others, should only been down with a pull request. Otherwise, changes to the master would be uncontrolled and cause confunsion. Before merging a branch the user should also have the most recent version available and merge with it locally before pushing.
